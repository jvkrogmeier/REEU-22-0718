    "Functions allow code to be more readable by allowing the hiding of details of an operation that may not be central to the understanding of the overall algorithm. Sometimes, this is called encapsulation. For example, perhaps we want to solve some sort of geometric problem, such as finding the height of a tree from the angle of the sun and the length of the shadow cast on the ground. The height calculation will involve intermediate calculations of trigonometric functions of the angle (e.g., sine, cosine, tangent). These sorts of intermediate calculations are naturally left to functions in python and other programming languages.\n",
